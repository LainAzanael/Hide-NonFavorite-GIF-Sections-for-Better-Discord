This BetterDiscord plugin hides all sections in the Discord GIF picker except for **Favorites**. I was tired of seeing ugly or downright disgusting GIFs every time I opened the section, and I also have necrophobia, so I didn't want any random zombie jump scares.

Originally based on a Tampermonkey script tested and confirmed working (as of 19.05.2025), this plugin adapts the same logic for use in the Discord desktop app via BetterDiscord.

## ✅ Features
- Hides **Trending**, **Reactions**, **Anime**, and other categories
- Keeps **Favorites** section
- Keeps **Search bar**
- Automatically updates when the drawer is opened or updated

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the file: `HideNonFavoriteGIFs.plugin.js` from the zip in the releases section
2. Open Discord and go to `User Settings → BetterDiscord → Plugins`
3. Click **“Open Plugins Folder”**
4. Move the plugin file into that folder
5. Enable the plugin from the BetterDiscord UI

## 🧪 Installation (for Browser via Tampermonkey)


1. Download the file: "! tamper monkey code for browser discord.txt" from the same zip as the app plugin in the releases section
2. Make sure you have the Tampermonkey extension installed in your browser:
3. Open Tampermonkey Dashboard
4. Click “+ Create a new script”
5. Delete everything in the editor and paste the contents of your file
6. Click File → Save or press Ctrl + S
7. Visit https://discord.com/app
8. Open the GIF picker — only Favorites should now appear!

## 🔒 Safe to Use
This plugin does **not collect or transmit** any user data.
It only modifies the visual DOM to hide irrelevant sections.
