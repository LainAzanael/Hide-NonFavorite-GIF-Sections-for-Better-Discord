This BetterDiscord plugin hides all sections in the Discord GIF picker except for **Favorites**. I was tired of seeing ugly or downright disgusting GIFs every time I opened the section, and I also have necrophobia, so I didn't want any random zombie jump scares.

Originally based on a Tampermonkey script tested and confirmed working (as of 19.05.2025), this plugin adapts the same logic for use in the Discord desktop app via BetterDiscord.

## ✅ Features
- Hides **Trending**, **Reactions**, **Anime**, and other categories
- Keeps **Favorites** section
- Keeps **Search bar**
- Automatically updates when the drawer is opened or updated

## 📦 Installation

1. Download the file: `HideNonFavoriteGIFs.plugin.js`
2. Open Discord and go to `User Settings → BetterDiscord → Plugins`
3. Click **“Open Plugins Folder”**
4. Move the plugin file into that folder
5. Enable the plugin from the BetterDiscord UI

## 🔒 Safe to Use
This plugin does **not collect or transmit** any user data.
It only modifies the visual DOM to hide irrelevant sections.
